                    <p>Dr. Assal Habibi is an Assistant Research Professor of Psychology at the Brain and Creativity Institute at University of Southern California. Her research takes a broad perspective on how biological dispositions and environmental factors interact and how learning experiences during childhood shape human development. She is an expert in the use of electrophysiologic and neuroimaging methods to investigate human brain structure and function and her research has published in several peer reviewed journals. Dr. Habibi completed her doctoral work at UC Irvine, investigating the effects of musical training in musicians, non-musicians and patients with auditory impairments. Dr. Habibi is a classically trained pianist and has many years of musical teaching experience with children.</p>

She completed her M.Sc. in Cognitive-Affective Neuroscience at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany. There she received her doctorate, where she studied cognitive flexibility processes and their neurophysiological underpinnings in healthy adolescents and patient populations. Coming from a family of artists, she worked as a singer and songwriter in Berlin before she found her passion for science. At the BCI, Vanessa will now combine her interests in both neuroscience and music. For her projects, she will conduct EEG and fMRI experiments to investigate the effects of musical training on performance in executive functions and the neuroplasticity of the brain.</p>
